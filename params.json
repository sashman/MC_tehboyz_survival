{"name":"MC tehboyz survival","body":"### Welcome to the Minecraft tehboyz survival mod page.\r\n\r\n_The mod is inspired by the movie Battle Royle, already existing PVP mods in the style of The Hunger Games and most of all by the Let's Plays on YouTube_. \r\n\r\n### Running the mod\r\n\r\nThe mod is a plugin for the bukkit Minecraft server. Instructions on how to set up the server can be found [here](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server).\r\nOnce the server is set-up, simply drop the **MC_tehboyz_survival.jar** into the **plugin** folder.\r\n\r\n### Motivations\r\n\r\nThe mod aims to provide a low player base Minecraft PVP experience. The mod caps the number of game participants to a relatively small number, for example 5 as opposed to 150 or so in the case of hunger games servers available on minecraftpvp.com.\r\n\r\nThis should allow for a longer and more elaborate gameplay. The participants should have enough time to build more sophisticated traps and possibly even a farm or two.\r\n\r\nAs the game time progresses the world bounds will become tighter, forcing the players into a smaller playable area and encouraging more encounters.\r\n\r\n#### Spectators\r\n\r\nEventually spectators should be supported by the mod. A player should be able to connect to the server while the game is in progress and automatically be set as an observer.\r\n\r\n### Version v0.1 (sashman, hugecannon)\r\n\r\n* Number of participating players is capped to a maximum number in the config file\r\n* Initially everybody is in creative mode\r\n* Block placing and creature spawning is disabled until the game starts\r\n* Once all players send **/ready** message, the game can begin\r\n* After a short countdown, participants are teleported in spread locations\r\n* Set participants to survival mode\r\n* World bounds are present and shrink every set time period\r\n* A number of game properties are available to be chnaged in the config file\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Sash (@sashman)\r\n* Hugh (@hugecannon)","tagline":"Minecraft mod featuring game play mechanics in the style of Battle Royale","google":"MC tehboyz survival","note":"Don't delete this file!
